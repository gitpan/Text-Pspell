Revision history for Perl extension Text::Pspell.

0.02  Wed Nov 28 01:00:33 PST 2001
      - fixed syntax in t/test.t for perl 5.00503.  I didn't like 
        print grep( { $_ eq 'bar' } @s_words ) ? "ok 15 @s_words\n" : "not ok 15\n";

      - added a cast to:
        PUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVpv( (char *)suggestion, 0 )));

      - added patch submitted by shadowhawk@xcom.pl
        - printf("%20s:  %s\n", *opt, pspell_config_retrieve(self->config, *opt) );
        + PerlIO_printf(PerlIO_stdout(),"%20s:  %s\n", *opt, pspell_config_retrieve(self->config, *opt) );

      - added README
