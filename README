Text::Pspell - Perl interface to the Pspell library

1) Make sure you have a current version of Pspell and Aspell installed.

   This was tested with:

   aspell-.33.7.1   http://aspell.sourceforge.net
   pspell-.12.2     http://pspell.sourceforge.net

   Tested with: 
      perl 5.6.0 on Linux, gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)
      perl 5.00503 on Solaris 2.6, gcc version 2.95.1 19990816 (release)

   You should install from source instead of from a RPM.  The RPM's
   may not have the english dictionary used in "make test".

   The author of Aspell/Pspell says:

     "While I recommend you use these binaries to avoid the hassle of 
     installing aspell yourself I do not officially support them."

   So I'd recommend building from source.  Or just don't run make test ;)


2) If you install Apsell and Pspell in a non-standard location (for example, if
   you don't have root access) then you will need to tell Makefile.PL where to
   find the library.  

   For example, if I installed Apsell/Pspell in /home/moseley/local/(lib|include),
   and I have my own "perl_lib" library:

   %perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/moseley/perl_lib \
   CCFLAGS=-I/home/moseley/local/include \
   LIBS='-L/home/moseley/local/lib -lpspell'

   Or maybe easier:

   %perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/moseley/perl_lib \
   CCFLAGS=-I/home/moseley/local/include -L/home/moseley/local/lib -lpspell'


3) I doubt this will work on Windows, but if it does, drop me a note.
